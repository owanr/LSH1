# LSH
Locality Sensitive Hashing Assignment

LSH:
Reads in given data and computes the Jaccard similarity between two documents of interests (docIDs given to by user).
Also produces a signature matrix and estimates the Jaccard similarity.
We can compare the estimates and actual calculation to see how they get closer and closer
as we increase the number of hash functions in the matrix.

LSH2:
Finds k nearest neighbors using both a brute-force approach and LSH approach
